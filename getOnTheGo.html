Matthew 28:19 KJV 
[19]Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. 
<p>Every believer has a mandate to reach out to the lost. It was given to us by Jesus Himself.</p>

<p>What did He ask us to preach?</p>

<p>Luke 24:47 KJV 
[47]And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</p>

We should preach repentance and remission of sins. 

The word <b>"repentance"</b> in the originals means "A change of mind". 

<b>"Remission"</b> means "deliverance" or "forgiveness". 

That means we should preach to sinners, telling them that their sins have been paid for. We preach so that they can have a change of mind. We don't preach and tell them to amend their ways. "Amend your ways" is NOT the gospel. It's their mind that needs amendment first, then their "ways" would follow as they grow in the knowledge of Christ!

<p>Now listen well, if you are a believer and you haven't spoken to any soul yet this year, then it's indeed VERY shameful! The message of the gospel is not reserved for some specific believers, it's for ALL who have been saved,</p>

<p>2Corinthians 5:19 KJV 
[19]To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.</p>

<p>If the unsaved dies and goes to hell, it's not God's fault but ours. God depends very much on the gospel of His Son heralded by us in order to save the lost! It's His will to save, I believe it grieves Him to see the one whom Jesus died for thrown into hell, 

2Peter 3:9 KJV 
[9]The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.

1Timothy 2:4KJV 
[4]Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.</p>

God wants men saved. That's HIS greatest desire. It's His heartbeat. That was why He sent Jesus to die and be raised from the dead! We must make this our heart desire too.</p>

<p>You see , heaven doesn't rejoice because you won a contract, they don't rejoice because you have finally married your choice partner, infact as much as God wants us healed, it brings no rejoicing in heaven... The only thing that causes heaven to rejoice is when they see a man Believe the gospel.
Jesus said this, 

Luke 15:7 KJV 
[7]I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance.

And they can't hear this gospel without you - the preacher, 

Romans 10:14 KJV 
[14]How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?

The wise ones will take this message to heart, 

Pro 11:30 KJV 
[30]The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; and he that winneth souls is wise.

And these ones will shine for the whole eternity, 

Daniel 12:3 KJV 
[3]And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.</p>

<p>You have sat down for too long. 

It's time to get on the *GO* for Jesus. 

Your passion for souls must be second to none even when things are not going well for you. 

The early church faced serious persecution but it didn't stop them from preaching Jesus, 

Acts 8:1&4 KJV 
[1]... And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.
[4] Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word.

Receive boldness to preach the gospel now in Jesus name, amen!.
