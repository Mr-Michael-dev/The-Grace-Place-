    <p>
In my little years in the faith, there is something i have noticed among some of us who are believers, especially with respect to those who know 'who they are in Christ', and this is what i want to briefly point out.

<p>I have seen some believers who are masters of confessions. I mean when you see them talking you will be amazed. For example, you'll hear, 'Yess, Gloraaaay, I'm the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus, I'm holy, blameless, faultless, I'm loved of the father, there is no sin in me, i am what the word says i am, i live and reign in life, etc. Now, these words are very very true. They are what we ALL have in redemption.</p>

But how come some of us who confess these, live the opposite of what we confess? 

<p>Why are we full of just words, yet lacking in actions that corresponds with our confessions?</p>

The answer is not far fetched. 

<p>The truth is that, the things we learnt in Christ still hangs in our head, it has not taken a hold of our hearts. Why? How come? Because we are not spending ample time IN prayer and the ministry of the word.</p>

Colossians 3:16 KJV 
[16]Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom...

<p>The word of God must dwell in you richly. In other words, the word of God must dwell in you such that, what it says, naturally flows from your conduct.</p>

You see, brethren, the Lord Jesus didnt make us righteous, holy, blameless, His workmanship etc, for only confessions. There is a reason why He gave us these many benefits. It is TO LIVE IT OUT. It is for men to see and know that indeed, we are the children of the living God,

Hear Jesus,

<p>Matthew 5:14-16 KJV
[14] Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.
[15] Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.
[16] Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.</p>

Jesus made very clear statements here. We are the light of the world. Our light must not be hidden. We must shine our lights for men to see and know that we are from another kingdom. And one of the ways to shine this light is through our Godly lifestyles.

<ul id="list2"><b>
<li>If you say, you are God's righteousness in Christ, then let right doings flow from your conduct.</li>

<li>If you say, you are Holy in Christ, then carnality should not be found in your manner of living.</li>

<li>If you say you have been washed by the blood of the lamb, then deliberately rise up from that dirty lifestyle.</li>
</b>
</ul>

Now, don't get me wrong, these things won't happen overnight, YOU GROW INTO THEM WITH PATIENCE,

Hear Jesus,

<p>Mark 4:28 KJV 
[28]For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.</p>

First... And then... And after that the full corn.

Hear Him again,

<p>Luke 8:15 KJV 
[15]But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience.</p>

It takes time for maturity to set in.

But if you have been in the faith for a while, and you know the truth of God's word, and yet we can't trace any fruit from your lifestyle, just mere words, it is because your heart is far from the Lord. You only honour him and his work with your lips, He hasn't settled in your heart yet.

<p>1Peter 2:16 KJV 
[16]As free, and not using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as the servants of God.</p>

What christ has done for us should inspire our sincere and genuine service, love for one another etc.

Don't Confess one thing among the brethren and then as you depart you turn into another man /woman. Let men trace christ from your lifestyle.

You say you are the righteousness of God in Christ, let righteousness be your way of life.

You say you are Holy in Christ, let holiness be seen in your manner of living.

You say you have the Spirit in you, then let men begin to see His fruit manifest in your life.

<p>All these are offshoots of being devoted DAILY to the Lord! When you read, study, and meditate on the word on a daily basis, coupled with a good prayer life, then all that Christ has wrought in you will begin to find expressions effortlessly.</p>
<p>Our confessions basically is to remind ourselves who God has made us to be in Christ, it must never be a substitute for prayer and the word!</p>

Let your confession match with your lifetsyle,

God has bless You.
